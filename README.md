# CMakeParser

CMake language parser, based on the grammar defined in the
[CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html)

## Goal

This project is the first step of the *CMake tools* project. It provides an easy to use, fully compliant, CMake language parser.

It is the base of the (in progress) [CMakeAST](https://github.com/FlorianChevassu/CMakeAST) project, providing a full CMake AST.
